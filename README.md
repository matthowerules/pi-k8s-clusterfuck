# pi-k8s-clusterfuck

Because I was bored, I did the cliche thing of building a k8s cluster on 4x rpi 4bs... 

If anyone decides to use this, do yourself a favor and get the 8GB models - Building a container and pushing it to a registry in GitLab was real fucking sketch and I'm surprised it did not crash... 

In lieu of that, I'm going to try Gitea, Jenkins, then migrate everything to helm.

Are we having fun yet!?!
